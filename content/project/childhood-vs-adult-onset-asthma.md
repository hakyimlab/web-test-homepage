### Application to childhood and adult onset asthma data in the UK Biobank

Regardless of how sophisticated they may be, analytical methods only matter if they can answer relevant scientific questions. We teamed up with Carole Ober and Dan Nicolae, experts in asthma genetics, to examine the shared and distinct genetic factors of childhood and adult onset asthma risk applying state of the art methods implemented in our labâ€™s analytical pipeline. For the first time, data on age of onset of asthma became available through the UK Biobank for a sufficiently large number of individuals. We seized the opportunity to identify novel genetic factors that are specific to childhood onset cases as well as those shared with adult onset cases. We found that genetic factors of adult onset asthma are a subset of childhood onset asthma with overall smaller effects suggesting a larger environmental component in adult cases. Tissue enrichment analysis suggested the role of allergy and epithelial barrier disfunction in childhood onset asthma and lung involvement in adult onset asthma. Both types shared immune components.
