The overarching goal of our research program is to develop computationally efficient and statistically sound methods to sift through the vast amounts of genomic and other high dimensional data with the goal of making discoveries that can be translated to improve human health.

To achieve this goal, we build and maintain an analytic infrastructure, i.e. a dry lab. This includes statistical and computational methods, pipelines and workflows, streamlined access to big data, and a research software engineering, bioinformatic and analysis team. This infrastructure constitutes a powerful instrument that gives us a unique vantage point from which discoveries can be made.

The cards below describe some of the highlights of our research.
