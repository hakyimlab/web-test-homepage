### Boosting the power to identify target genes by exploiting the tissue sharing of gene expression regulation

An unexpected finding from the GTEx consortium (large scale transcriptome study of 900 organ donors with whole body tissue sampled across 49 tissues) was the widespread sharing of genetic regulation of expression traits across tissues. We estimated that more than half of the eQTLs (variants associated with expression levels) are active across all tissues. One implication of this is that eQTL-based studies will have little specificity to narrow down the tissue where disease initiates. However, one can take advantage of this lack of specificity and consider the different tissue panels as independent experiments and aggregate the information across all of them. We developed MultiXcan to implement this idea and show its effectiveness. More details can be found [in this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889)
