### Genetic architecture of expression traits across tissues

We investigated the genetic architecture of gene expression traits, which are important intermediate processes to understand the mechanisms by which genetic variation affect complex diseases and traits. We found that in contrast to the polygenic nature of complex diseases, most of the variation of gene expression traits is driven by a small number of variants (eQTLs). In addition to providing insight into the biology of the transcriptome, this finding has practical implications for the best approaches to predict gene expression traits.
